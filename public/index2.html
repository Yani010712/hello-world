       <h1> About me.</h1>

       <p> I was born and raised in Florida, not in the state of Florida, but a small town in Cuba with the same name. I do not remember having passion for any profession when I was younger so when I finished high school I entered the University of Computer Science of Havana only for the wish to go to university, but in reality,  I had never  had a computer in my life, so my knowledge of computing was vary basic at the beginning.  <br><br>

      I graduated without obstacles, but without a lot of enthusiasm. Two years later, I was lucky enough to emigrate to the United States, where for reasons that no one knows I started working as a TV producer. In the beginning, it was enjoyable, but after a while, I began to miss working in technology and resigned that job.<br><br>

      Was then when I realized that it had been five years and the world of technology moved very fast, and I had stayed behind,  it was then when I began to research how I could get back on track with technology and discovered Wyncode, a coding Bootcamp. For the first time in my life, I feel that I found my true passion, and I am pleased about that.<br><br>

      Now that I love being a software engineer, I am very interested in using innovative technology to solve educational, social, and environmental problems. <a href="more-about-me.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">More about me.</a></p>
